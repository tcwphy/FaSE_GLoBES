# The configure script should have replaced anything as required to

# This simple Makefile is for the GLoBES examples
#
# Compile example files with ``make example1'' etc.
#
# This Makefile assumes dynamic libraries, installed to either
# the default prefix /usr/local/ or to a user-defined directory 
# called ${prefix}.
#
# For linking against a specific version of GLoBES, libglobes.so can be 
# replaced by the respective library, such as libglobes.so.0.0.1
