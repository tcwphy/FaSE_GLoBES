# FaSE_GLoBES
This package serves to provide a toolkit for GLoBES to check the general flavor-symmetry models.
Two c-codes are included in this package: 'FASE_GLoBES.c' and 'model-input.c'.
The user just include these two files to compile the code.
The function of 'FASE_GLoBES.c' is to simulate the probability profile and the prior value for those oscillation
parameters, transilated from the model parameter given by the user. All the input from users, including
model set up and any restrictions on model parameters, should be put in 'model-input.c'.
More introductions can be see the user maunal in '/doc/FaSE.pdf'.
