# FaSE_GLoBES
This package serves to provide a toolkit for GLoBES to check the general flavor-symmetry models.
Two c-codes are included in this package: 'FaSE_GLoBES.c' and 'model-input.c'. The user just
includes their binary files to compile the code. The function of 'FaSE_GLoBES.c' is to simulate the
probability profile and the prior value for those oscillation parameters, translated from the model
parameter given by the user. All the input from users, including model set up and any restrictions
on model parameters, should be put in 'model-input.c'. More details can be see the user
maunal in '/doc/FaSE_GLoBES.pdf'.

For users who are usingg GLoBES for the first time, please visit GLoBES website:
